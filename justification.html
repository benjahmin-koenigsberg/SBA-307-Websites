                <p>Another carnistic defense is justification. The main way we learn to justify eating animals is by learning to believe
                that the myths of meat, eggs, and dairy are the facts of meat, eggs and dairy. <br><br>These myths are expressed largely through
                the Three Ns of Justification: <strong> animals is normal, natural, and necessary.

             <p>Eating animal products is such a normative part of society that most people on a daily basis fail to cognitively link
            the meat on their plate with the animals slaughtered.
<br><br>
            This dissociation between meat and animal is reinforced by the invisibility of the chain of meat production in modern
            society. Animals are slaughtered away from view. A relatively small group of labourers are responsible for the
            production of 318 million tonnes of meat (not counting fish and seafood) that we consume globally each year. At market,
            animal flesh is further processed into sellable units that little resemble the animal it came from.
<br><br>
            Studies by Jonas Kunst and colleagues show that when you draw people’s attention to the animal origins of meat, their
            concern about slaughter increases and their appetite for meat momentarily declines. People don’t like to dwell on the
            animal origins of their meal, and modern meat production is strategically designed to help consumers forget.</p>

               <p>A common myth that is still pervasive today is that humans need to eat meat to get essential nutrients for their health
            or, if you are a body builder, to grow muscle. Indeed, this was the most frequent justification for eating meat that we
            observed in our study.
<br><br>
            Despite evidence to the contrary, many people still believe that meat is either the exclusive or primary source of
            protein for our bodies. Meat companies take advantage of this myth. You may have noticed that restaurants often label
            the meat options ‘proteins’ – a strategy that would be lost on elephants and gorillas, who grow massive exclusively on
            plants.</p>

           <p>The final barrier to ditching meat is the belief that it is natural for humans to dominate animals. It can be comforting
        to believe that humans are on top of some natural food chain. We have the power and it is our privilege to wield that
        power.

        Research by Kristof Dhont and Gordon Hodson has shown that there is a direct link between the way people think about
        human supremacy over animals and the attitudes people have towards human inequality. People who tend to think it is our
        right to dominate other species also tend to believe that there is natural order to society, with some individuals at
        the top and others at the bottom.

        In other words, viewing the world in terms of natural hierarchies not only fuels our beliefs about human supremacy over
        animals, it can perpetuate inequality within society as well.</p>
